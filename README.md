# Git Branching and Merging

## Merging Changes

After both Tom and Jerry have pushed their changes, you (or another team member) can review and merge these changes into the main project. The process involves

1. Creating a Pull Request 
2. Merging the Pull Request into the main branch. 

Understanding Pull Requests: A Pull Request (PR) is a feature used in GitHub (and other Git-based version control systems) that allows you to notify team members about the changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository. Essentially, it's a request to review and pull in your contribution to the main project. Pull requests are central to the collaborative development process, enabling team members to discuss, review, and make further changes before changes are merged.

The image below shows the a representation of Git pull request:
